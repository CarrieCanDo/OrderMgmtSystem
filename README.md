# Order Management System

## Project Overview

This project is an Order Management System built using **Spring Boot**. It manages orders and products, allowing for flexible handling of different products across various industries. The system provides basic CRUD functionalities for both orders and products.

## Methodology

The project is developed following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. Each functionality in the service layer was tested using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** for mocking repository interactions. This ensures that every feature is tested as it is developed, maintaining a high level of quality and code coverage.

## Features

- CRUD operations for Orders and Products
- Order status management using Enum (`OrderStatus`)
- Relationships between Orders and Products (Many-to-Many)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all service layer methods

## Test Cases

The following test cases were written using **JUnit 5**:

1. **OrderServiceTest**
    - Create Order
    - Get Order by ID
    - Update Order
    - Delete Order

2. **ProductServiceTest**
    - Create Product
    - Get Product by ID
    - Update Product
    - Delete Product

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully with 100% success rate. The tests ensure that the system behaves as expected, handling both valid inputs and edge cases effectively.
